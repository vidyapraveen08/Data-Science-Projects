# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Description

This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry using machine learning models. Customer churn is a critical metric for businesses as it indicates the rate at which customers stop using a company's services. By predicting churn, companies can take proactive measures to retain customers, thus improving their profitability and customer satisfaction.

## Tools and Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following tools and libraries:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Load the dataset and perform initial preprocessing steps.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the dataset to understand the underlying patterns and distributions.
3. **Model Development:** Develop machine learning models to predict customer churn.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the developed models using appropriate metrics.
5. **Interpretation and Recommendations:** Provide insights and recommendations based on the model's predictions.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd TelecomCustomerChurnPrediction
   ```

2. **Install the Required Libraries:**
   Install the necessary libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook TelecomCustomerChurnPrediction.ipynb
   ```

4. **Analyze the Results:**
   Follow the steps in the notebook to load the data, preprocess it, develop models, evaluate their performance, and interpret the results.

## Results and Insights

The project provides detailed steps to predict customer churn using various machine learning models. It includes data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation, along with visualizations and insights to help understand the factors contributing to customer churn.
