# Used Cars Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a dataset of used cars to derive meaningful insights using statistical methods. The analysis is performed using Python and is documented in a Jupyter notebook. The project utilizes the `thinkstats2.py` library, which provides various statistical functions and classes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `autos.csv`, which contains data about used cars with the following attributes:

- `dateCrawled`: The date when the car ad was crawled
- `name`: The name of the car
- `seller`: The type of seller (private or dealer)
- `offerType`: The type of offer
- `price`: The price of the car
- `abtest`: A/B test group
- `vehicleType`: The type of vehicle
- `yearOfRegistration`: The year the car was registered
- `gearbox`: The type of gearbox (manual or automatic)
- `powerPS`: The power of the car in PS
- `model`: The model of the car
- `kilometer`: The mileage of the car
- `monthOfRegistration`: The month the car was registered
- `fuelType`: The type of fuel used by the car
- `brand`: The brand of the car
- `notRepairedDamage`: Whether the car has unrepaired damage
- `dateCreated`: The date the ad was created
- `nrOfPictures`: The number of pictures in the ad
- `postalCode`: The postal code of the seller
- `lastSeen`: The last date the ad was seen online

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `ProjectCode.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code and visualizations.
- `thinkstats2.py`: A Python script providing various statistical functions and classes.
- `autos.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vidyapraveen08/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/eda-on-used-cars
   cd eda-on-used-cars
   cd notepads
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. Open and run the `ProjectCode.ipynb` notebook to execute the analysis.

## Usage

The main analysis is contained within the Jupyter notebook `ProjectCode.ipynb`. Open the notebook and run the cells to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.
